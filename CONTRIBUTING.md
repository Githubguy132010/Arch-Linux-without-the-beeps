# Contributing to Arch Linux Without the Beeps

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.

## Any contributions you make will be under our License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](../../issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its License.

## Testing and Documentation Updates

When contributing to this project, please ensure that your code is well-tested and that the documentation is up to date. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Write Tests**: If you've added code that should be tested, add tests to cover the new functionality. Use the existing test suite as a reference.
2. **Update Documentation**: If you've changed APIs or added new features, update the documentation accordingly. This includes the `README.md` file and any other relevant documentation files.
3. **Run Tests**: Ensure that the test suite passes before submitting your pull request. This helps maintain the stability of the project.

## Coding Standards

To maintain consistency and readability in the codebase, please adhere to the following coding standards:

1. **Follow Conventions**: Use camelCase for variable and function names, and PascalCase for class names. Follow the existing style in the codebase.
2. **Use Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic and algorithms. This helps other contributors understand your code.
3. **Keep Functions Small**: Write small, modular functions that serve a single responsibility. This enhances reusability and simplifies bug fixes or extensions.
4. **Avoid Nested Functions**: Avoid overly nested functions or methods to limit cyclomatic complexity.
5. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure that all inputs are thoroughly validated before being processed within the application.
6. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement robust error handling to provide clear messages and logging mechanisms that enable developers to quickly locate and resolve issues.
7. **Optimize Performance**: Write code with algorithmic efficiency in mind. Avoid redundant iterations and use efficient data structures where appropriate.
8. **Maintain Security**: Avoid known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and buffer overflows. Use prepared statements and avoid vulnerable APIs.
9. **Document Your Code**: Each function should be accompanied by clear and concise documentation describing its functionality and limitations. Include example implementations for practical application.
10. **Review and Edit**: Proofread your code for clarity and completeness. Have someone else review it to ensure it meets the project's standards.
