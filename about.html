    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This project was created to help users install Arch Linux without the annoying beeps that can occur during the installation process. It aims to provide a smoother and more pleasant installation experience.</p>
    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Thomas Brugman. I live in Gouda (Netherlands) and have a keen interest in computers and laptops. I enjoy testing new operating systems and reporting bugs. I'm currently learning YAML and Bash, and I already have some experience with both. I use VS Code as my development environment and am familiar with some fundamental programming concepts.</p>
    <p>I'm working on a project called 'Arch-Linux-without-the-beeps', (this is the site for it) which ensures that the system does not produce beep sounds during installation and builds ISO files locally using Docker. I prefer using sudo in scripts and am open to feedback and new features for my project.</p>
